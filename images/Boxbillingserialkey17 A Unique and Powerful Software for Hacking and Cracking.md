## Generating a Serial Key 17
 
A serial key 17 is a special type of license key that can be used for custom products that require a license validation. For example, if you are selling software licenses or downloadable products that need to be activated with a serial key, you can use BoxBilling to generate and manage them.
 
To generate a serial key 17, you will need to create a custom license plugin that defines how the serial key is generated and validated. A license plugin is a PHP class with one method generate that returns the serial key as a string. License plugins are located at bb-modules/Servicelicense/Plugin folder. You can use the default plugin at bb-modules/Servicelicense/Plugin/Simple.php as a template.
 
The generate method takes two parameters: $order and $config. The $order parameter is an array that contains information about the order such as id, client\_id, product\_id, etc. The $config parameter is an array that contains custom configuration options for the plugin such as length, prefix, suffix, etc. You can use these parameters to customize how the serial key is generated based on the order details or your own preferences.
 
For example, if you want to generate a serial key 17 that consists of 17 alphanumeric characters with a prefix of BB- and a suffix of -SK17, you can use this code:
