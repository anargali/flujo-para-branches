# How to Boost Your Creativity with Graphic Design Thinking
 
Graphic design thinking is a process of exploring and generating ideas for visual communication. It goes beyond brainstorming, which is often limited to generating a large quantity of ideas without evaluating them. Graphic design thinking involves defining problems, researching, sketching, prototyping, testing, and refining solutions. It also draws on various methods and tools from other disciplines, such as psychology, sociology, anthropology, and art.

This book is a collection of essays and case studies by renowned designers and educators who share their insights and experiences on how to enhance your creative thinking skills. Whether you are a student, a professional, or a hobbyist, you can benefit from applying these methods to your own projects.
 
## Defining Problems
 
The first step of graphic design thinking is to define the problem you want to solve. This involves clarifying the goals, audience, context, and constraints of your project. You can use various techniques to help you define the problem, such as:
 
- **Mind mapping**: This is a technique of creating a visual diagram that shows the relationships between different concepts and keywords related to your topic. You can start with a central word or phrase and then branch out with subtopics and associations. Mind mapping can help you organize your thoughts, generate new ideas, and identify gaps in your knowledge.
- **Interviewing**: This is a technique of asking questions to people who are relevant to your project, such as potential users, clients, experts, or stakeholders. Interviewing can help you understand their needs, preferences, opinions, and behaviors. You can use open-ended questions to elicit more information and stories, and follow-up questions to probe deeper into specific issues.
- **Persona**: This is a technique of creating a fictional character that represents a typical user of your product or service. Persona can help you empathize with your target audience and design for their needs and goals. You can include details such as name, age, gender, occupation, hobbies, personality traits, motivations, challenges, and scenarios.

## Getting Ideas
 
The second step of graphic design thinking is to get ideas for possible solutions. This involves generating a large quantity and variety of ideas without judging them. You can use various techniques to help you get ideas, such as:

- **Brainstorming**: This is a technique of generating ideas by quickly writing down or saying whatever comes to your mind related to your topic. Brainstorming can help you overcome mental blocks and stimulate your imagination. You can do it individually or in groups, using words or images.
- **SCAMPER**: This is a technique of generating ideas by applying seven different types of transformations to an existing product or service: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse. SCAMPER can help you modify or improve an existing solution or create a new one.
- **Visual research**: This is a technique of collecting images that are relevant to your project from various sources, such as books, magazines, websites, blogs, social media platforms etc. Visual research can help you find inspiration,
discover trends,
learn from other designers,
and develop your own style.

## Creating Form
 
The third step of graphic design thinking is to create form for your ideas. This involves translating your ideas into visual elements such as shapes, colors, fonts, images, icons, layouts etc. You can use various techniques to help you create form, such as:
