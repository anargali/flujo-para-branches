Kingdom Rush Frontiers - Premium - All Heroes Unlocked is a modded version of the game that gives you unlimited money, gems, stars, and heroes. You can use these resources to upgrade your towers, buy new items, and recruit new heroes to join your army. You can also unlock all the achievements and secrets that the game has to offer. With this mod, you can experience the game in a whole new way, and explore every aspect of it without any restrictions.
 
One of the best features of Kingdom Rush Frontiers is the variety of heroes that you can choose from. There are 16 different heroes in the game, each with their own skills, abilities, and personalities. Some of them are warriors, some are mages, some are archers, and some are even dragons. You can switch between them during the game, and use their special powers to turn the tide of battle. However, in the original version of the game, you have to pay real money to unlock some of the heroes, or complete certain levels or challenges to get them. This can be frustrating for some players who want to try out all the heroes and see what they can do.
 
That's why Kingdom Rush Frontiers - Premium - All Heroes Unlocked is a great option for those who want to have all the heroes available from the start. You don't have to spend any money or time to get them. You can simply select any hero you want from the menu, and enjoy their unique gameplay and style. You can also mix and match different heroes to create your own strategies and combinations. For example, you can use Alric, the warrior king, to lead your troops and deal melee damage; Mirage, the assassin princess, to sneak behind enemy lines and assassinate key targets; Bonehart, the skeletal dragon, to fly over obstacles and breathe fire; or Cronan, the beastmaster, to summon animals and plants to aid you.
 
With Kingdom Rush Frontiers - Premium - All Heroes Unlocked, you can have more fun and excitement with the game than ever before. You can experiment with different towers, items, heroes, and levels without worrying about running out of resources or missing out on anything. You can also challenge yourself with harder difficulties and modes that will test your skills and strategies. If you love tower defense games and want to experience Kingdom Rush Frontiers in its full glory, then this mod is for you.
