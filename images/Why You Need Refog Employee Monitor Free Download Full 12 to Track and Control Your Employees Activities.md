## Step 1: Create or Join a Project
 
To use Autodesk Collaboration for Revit 2017, you need to create or join a project on the Autodesk A360 platform. A360 is a cloud-based service that provides storage, sharing, and collaboration tools for design and engineering projects. You can sign up for a free trial or a subscription at [https://a360.autodesk.com/](https://a360.autodesk.com/).
 
Once you have an A360 account, you can create a new project or join an existing one. To create a new project, click on the "+" icon on the top left corner of the A360 dashboard and fill in the project details. To join an existing project, you need to receive an invitation from the project owner or administrator. You can accept the invitation by clicking on the link in the email or by logging into A360 and clicking on the "Join" button next to the project name.
 
## Step 2: Enable Cloud Worksharing
 
After creating or joining a project on A360, you need to enable cloud worksharing on your Revit model. Cloud worksharing allows you to upload your model to the cloud and sync changes with other team members. To enable cloud worksharing, open your Revit model and go to the Collaborate tab. Click on the "Collaborate" button and select "In A360" as the collaboration type. You will be prompted to sign in to your A360 account and select the project and folder where you want to store your model. Click on "Initiate" to upload your model to the cloud.
 
## Step 3: Invite Team Members
 
Once your model is uploaded to the cloud, you can invite other team members to join your collaboration session. To invite team members, go to the Collaborate tab and click on the "Manage Cloud Models" button. You will see a list of your cloud models and their status. Select the model you want to share and click on the "Invite" button. You can enter the email addresses of the team members you want to invite or select them from your A360 contacts. You can also assign roles and permissions to each team member, such as viewer, editor, or administrator. Click on "Send Invitations" to send out the invitations.
 
## Step 4: Work on Your Model
 
After inviting team members, you can start working on your model as usual. You can make changes, add elements, create views, etc. You can also see who else is working on the model by looking at the user icons on the bottom right corner of the Revit window. You can hover over an icon to see the user name and role.

You can also set up automatic synchronization intervals in the Options dialog box.
 
## Step 5: Communicate with Team Members
 
One of the benefits of Autodesk Collaboration for Revit 2017 is that it allows you to communicate with other team members in real time using the Communicator chat tool.
