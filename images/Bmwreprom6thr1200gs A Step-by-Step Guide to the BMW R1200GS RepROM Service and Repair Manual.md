## What is the BMW RepROM?
 
The BMW RepROM is an acronym for Repair Manual on CD-ROM. It is a digital version of the printed service manual that BMW dealers use to service their motorcycles. The RepROM contains all the information that you need to perform routine maintenance and repairs on your bike, such as oil changes, brake pads replacement, valve adjustment, etc.
 
The RepROM also has some advantages over the printed manual, such as:
 
- It is updated regularly with the latest technical information and service bulletins.
- It allows you to select your specific model and options, and generates the relevant pages on demand.
- It has interactive features such as zooming, searching, printing, and bookmarking.
- It has hyperlinks that connect related topics and sections.
- It has videos and animations that demonstrate some procedures and tests.

The RepROM is not a free download that you can find on the internet. It is a licensed product that you have to purchase from BMW or authorized dealers. The cost of the RepROM is about $135 USD. You can also find some alternative manuals from other publishers, such as Haynes or Jim Von Baden, but they may not be as comprehensive or up-to-date as the RepROM.
  
## Where to get the BMW RepROM?
 
The easiest way to get the BMW RepROM is to order it online from the official BMW Motorrad website. You can choose your country and language, and then select your model and year from the drop-down menus. You will then see a list of available products for your bike, including the RepROM. You can add it to your cart and proceed to checkout.
 
You can also get the RepROM from your local BMW dealer or authorized service center. They may have it in stock or they can order it for you. You may have to provide your VIN number or proof of ownership to verify that you own a BMW motorcycle.
 
Once you get the RepROM CD-ROM, you will need a Windows PC with a CD-ROM drive and an internet connection to install it. You will also need an activation code that comes with the CD-ROM package. The activation code is unique for each CD-ROM and can only be used once.
