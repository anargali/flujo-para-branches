## Consider the Language and Accent of the Voice
 
NaturalReader 11 supports over 20 languages and accents, including English (US, UK, Australian, Indian), French (France, Canada), German, Italian, Spanish (Spain, Mexico), Portuguese (Brazil, Portugal), Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and more. You can see the full list of voices on their website[^1^].
 
Depending on your preference and purpose, you may want to choose a voice that matches the language and accent of the text you are reading. For example, if you are reading a British novel, you may want to use a British voice to enhance the authenticity and immersion. Or if you are learning a foreign language, you may want to use a native speaker's voice to improve your pronunciation and comprehension.
 
## Consider the Gender and Style of the Voice
 
NaturalReader 11 also offers different genders and styles of voices, such as male, female, child, adult, friendly, chat, sad, terrified, shouting, whispering, and cheerful. You can sample these voices on their website[^2^] or in their online app[^3^].
 
Depending on your mood and preference, you may want to choose a voice that suits your personality and taste. For example, if you are reading a bedtime story to your child, you may want to use a child's voice or a friendly voice to make it more engaging and fun. Or if you are reading a horror story to yourself, you may want to use a terrified voice or a whispering voice to create more suspense and thrill.
