# How to Tie Turk's Head Knots with a Cookbook and a Tool
 
Turk's head knots are decorative and versatile knots that can be used for bracelets, handles, mats, and more. They have a cylindrical shape and a woven texture that can vary depending on the number of leads and bights (crossings and loops) in the knot. There are hundreds of possible combinations of leads and bights, but how can you learn to tie them all?
 
One way is to use a cookbook and a tool. A cookbook is a book that provides step-by-step instructions for tying specific knots, using diagrams and codes. A tool is a device that helps you hold the cord in place while you weave it around pins or screws. Together, they make it easier to create complex and beautiful turk's head knots.

One of the most comprehensive cookbooks for turk's head knots is the *Turk's Head Cookbook* by Don Burrhus. It consists of three volumes: Volume 1 covers regular basket-weave turk's head knots with up to 20 leads and 20 bights; Volume 2 covers herringbone or twill weave turk's head knots with up to 20 leads and 20 bights; and Volume 3 covers globe knots, which are spherical versions of turk's head knots. The cookbook also comes with a flat knot tool that has adjustable screws for different pin settings.

If you want to learn how to tie turk's head knots with a cookbook and a tool, here are some tips:
 
- Read the introductory texts in each volume to understand the basics of turk's head knots, such as how to read the diagrams and codes, how to use the tool, and how to tighten and finish the knots.
- Choose a knot that you want to tie from the cookbook. You can use the grid charts, page finders, or indexes to find a knot by its number of leads and bights.
- Set up your tool according to the pin settings given for each knot. You can use the flat knot tool that comes with the cookbook, or make your own tool from wood or paper cylinders and pins.
- Follow the diagrams and codes in the cookbook to weave your cord around the pins on the tool. Make sure you follow the over-under pattern correctly and keep track of your position on the tool.
- When you have completed one round of weaving, slide the knot off the tool and tighten it gradually by pulling on each strand. Adjust the shape and size of the knot as you tighten it.
- Cut off any excess cord and tuck in the ends under the knot. You can also add beads, charms, or other embellishments to your knot if you like.
