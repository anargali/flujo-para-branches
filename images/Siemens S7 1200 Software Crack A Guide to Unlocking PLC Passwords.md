## Step 3: Add Devices and Configure Hardware
` `
Once you have created a new project, you can add devices and configure hardware settings. To add devices, click on the "Add new device" button on the toolbar or select "Project > Add new device" from the menu. You will see a list of available devices that you can choose from. Select the SIMATIC S7-1200 PLC that matches your model and click "OK". You will see the device appear in the project tree on the left side of the screen.
` `
To configure hardware settings, double-click on the device in the project tree or select "Device view" from the toolbar. You will see a graphical representation of your PLC and its modules. You can drag and drop modules to add or remove them, or right-click on them to change their properties. You can also use the "Hardware catalog" on the right side of the screen to browse and select modules.
` `
## Step 4: Program Your PLC Logic
` `
After configuring hardware settings, you can program your PLC logic using different programming languages and editors. To program your PLC logic, double-click on the device in the project tree or select "Program blocks" from the toolbar. You will see a list of program blocks that you can create or edit. You can use different types of program blocks such as organization blocks (OB), function blocks (FB), functions (FC), data blocks (DB), or system function blocks (SFB).
` `
To create a new program block, click on the "Add new block" button on the toolbar or select "Project > Add new block" from the menu. You will be asked to enter a block name and a block type. You can also choose a programming language such as ladder logic (LAD), function block diagram (FBD), structured text (ST), statement list (STL), or sequential function chart (SFC). After creating a new program block, you can open it in an editor window and write your code using graphical or textual elements.
` `
## Step 5: Test and Debug Your PLC Program
` `
After programming your PLC logic, you can test and debug your PLC program using various tools and features. To test and debug your PLC program, click on the "Online" button on the toolbar or select "Online > Go online" from the menu. You will be asked to connect to your PLC via an Ethernet cable or a USB cable. Once connected, you can download your program to your PLC or upload it from your PLC.
` `
To test your PLC program, you can use different modes such as run mode, stop mode, monitor mode, or modify mode.
