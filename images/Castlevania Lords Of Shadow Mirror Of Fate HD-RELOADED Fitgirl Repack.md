If you are a fan of the Castlevania series, you might be interested in the fitgirl repack of Castlevania Lords of Shadow Mirror of Fate HD-RELOADED, a side-scrolling action-adventure game that follows the story of the Belmont family across generations. The game was originally released for Nintendo 3DS in 2013, and later ported to PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 with improved graphics and sound. The fitgirl repack is based on the PC version and reduces the original size of 2 GB to 576 MB, without compromising the quality or content of the game.

The game features four playable characters: Gabriel Belmont, the protagonist of Castlevania Lords of Shadow who became the vampire lord Dracula; Trevor Belmont, his son and a knight of the Brotherhood of Light; Simon Belmont, Trevor's son and a barbarian warrior; and Alucard, Dracula's son and a half-vampire. Each character has their own abilities, weapons and skills, and the game switches between them as the story progresses. The game combines platforming, combat, puzzles and exploration, with some elements borrowed from the Metroidvania subgenre. The game also has a boss rush mode and a leaderboards system.
 
The fitgirl repack includes the latest update v1.0.684579 that fixes some bugs and improves performance. It also has an optional Russian text/audio translation (compiled by Siberian Gremlin) that can be installed during setup. The repack is 100% lossless and MD5 perfect, meaning that all files are identical to originals after installation. The installation takes only 1-2 minutes, and the game can be run from the Language Selector.exe in the game root folder. The repack is compatible with some filehosters and torrent trackers, but not with others.
