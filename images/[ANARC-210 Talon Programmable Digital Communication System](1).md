The system can output power ranging from 10 to 23 watts depending on the mode and frequency[^1^]. The system also has two guard receiver frequencies (121.5 MHz and 243 MHz) and a channel scan feature for four preset channels[^1^]. The system can store up to 250 normal preset channels and 250 ECCM preset channels[^1^]. The system can be field programmable and has an embedded FM immunity filter[^1^].
 
The AN/ARC-210 Talon system has a weight of 12.2 lbs, a width of 5.0 in, a height of 6.7 in and a length of 11.4 in[^1^]. The system requires a power supply of +28 V dc and consumes 154 watts during transmission and 34 watts during reception[^1^]. The system meets the MIL-STD-461E and MIL-STD-810E test specifications[^1^].

## History and Development
 
The AN/ARC-210 Talon system is the successor of the AN/ARC-164 Have Quick II system, which was developed in the 1980s to provide secure and jam-resistant communications for tactical aircraft. The AN/ARC-210 Talon system was first introduced in the early 1990s and has since undergone several upgrades and enhancements to improve its performance and functionality. The first generation of the Talon system was the RT-1478, which provided basic VHF/UHF AM/FM and Have Quick I/II capabilities. The second generation was the RT-1556, which added SATURN and SINCGARS capabilities. The third generation was the RT-1794, which added TALON and TALON CUID capabilities. The fourth generation was the RT-1851, which added TALON II and Quicklook 1A capabilities. The fifth generation was the RT-1939, which added Citadel encryption and MIL-STD-188-114 data interface capabilities. The sixth and current generation is the RT-2036 (C), which meets the Cryptographic Modernization mandate and adds networked communications capabilities.
 
## Applications and Benefits
 
The AN/ARC-210 Talon system is widely used by various military platforms, such as fighters, bombers, helicopters, transports, tankers, maritime patrol aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, ships and ground vehicles. The system provides interoperability with other US and allied forces through common waveforms and encryption modes. The system also provides enhanced situational awareness and survivability through networked communications and beyond-line-of-sight connectivity. The system enables the warfighter to communicate effectively in various scenarios, such as air-to-air, air-to-ground, air-to-sea, ground-to-air and ground-to-ground operations. The system also supports various missions, such as combat air patrol, close air support, air interdiction, reconnaissance, surveillance, search and rescue, special operations and humanitarian assistance.
