## What are NFSU2 Trainers and how do they work?
 
NFSU2 Trainers are software applications that run in the background while you play the game. They usually access and change the memory addresses and values used by the game, which affect the gameplay. For example, a trainer can increase your money by adding a certain amount to your current balance, or prevent your engine from blowing up by setting its durability to maximum.
 
Trainers usually have a user interface that lets you activate or deactivate different functions by pressing shortcut keys. Some trainers also have a readme file that explains how to use them and what each function does. You should always read the readme file before using a trainer, as some functions may not work with certain versions of the game or may cause glitches or crashes.
