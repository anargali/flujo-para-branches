# How to Make Perfumed Agarbatti at Home
 
Agarbatti, also known as incense sticks, are used for various purposes such as religious ceremonies, aromatherapy, meditation, and home fragrance. They are made of bamboo sticks coated with a paste of aromatic materials such as resins, gums, oils, herbs, spices, and flowers. The fragrance of agarbatti depends on the type and proportion of ingredients used in the paste.

If you want to make your own perfumed agarbatti at home, you will need some basic materials and equipment, as well as a suitable formula for the perfume. Here are some steps to guide you:
 
1. Gather the materials. You will need bamboo sticks, charcoal powder, sawdust, jigat powder (a natural binder), water, a mixing bowl, a wooden spoon, a rolling board, a rolling pin, a knife, a drying rack, and a storage container. You will also need some essential oils or synthetic perfumes of your choice. You can find these materials online or in local stores that sell incense making supplies.
2. Prepare the paste. In a mixing bowl, add charcoal powder, sawdust, and jigat powder in a ratio of 3:2:1. For example, if you want to make 100 grams of paste, you will need 60 grams of charcoal powder, 40 grams of sawdust, and 20 grams of jigat powder. Mix them well with a wooden spoon. Then add water gradually and knead the mixture until it forms a smooth and sticky dough.
3. Add the perfume. Depending on the strength and quality of your perfume, you will need to add different amounts of it to the paste. A general rule is to use 10% to 20% of perfume by weight of the paste. For example, if you have 100 grams of paste, you will need 10 to 20 grams of perfume. You can use one or more perfumes to create your own blend. Add the perfume gradually and mix it well with the paste.
4. Coat the sticks. Take a bamboo stick and dip one end of it into the paste. Then roll it on a rolling board with a rolling pin until it is evenly coated with a thin layer of paste. Cut off the excess paste with a knife and place the stick on a drying rack. Repeat this process for all the sticks.
5. Dry the sticks. Place the drying rack in a well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight and heat sources. Let the sticks dry for at least 24 hours or until they are hard and brittle.
6. Store the sticks. Once the sticks are dry, you can store them in an airtight container or a plastic bag. Keep them away from moisture and heat sources. You can also label them with the name and date of your perfume.

Congratulations! You have made your own perfumed agarbatti at home. You can use them for your personal use or gift them to your friends and family.
