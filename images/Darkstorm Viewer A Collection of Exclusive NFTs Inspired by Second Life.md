Darkstorm Viewer is one of the most popular copybot tools among Second Life users who want to create backups of their own creations, explore hidden regions, modify their appearance, or obtain items that are otherwise unavailable or expensive. However, it is also controversial and often considered illegal or unethical by Linden Lab, the company that owns and operates Second Life, and by many content creators and residents who see it as a threat to their intellectual property rights and income.
 
Darkstorm Viewer can be downloaded from [darkstormviewer.tk](https://darkstormviewer.tk), where users can also find tutorials, support and feedback. The latest version of Darkstorm Viewer is 6.2.0, which was released on November 28, 2020. It includes updates from Firestorm 6.4.13, some fixes and improvements.
