VMWare ThinApp Enterprise is a software development tool that allows IT organizations to provide applications to end users without managing the complexity of application conflicts and prerequisites or operating system dependencies[^1^]. By isolating applications from their underlying operating systems, VMWare ThinApp Enterprise eliminates application-to-application and application-to-OS conflicts, and streamlines delivery and management[^2^].

VMWare ThinApp Enterprise 5.2.2 Build 4435715 is the latest version of this tool, which offers improved performance, stability, and compatibility with various operating systems and applications. It also supports Windows 10 and Internet Explorer 11, as well as virtualizing legacy web applications that rely on Internet Explorer 6[^1^].
 
One of the main advantages of VMWare ThinApp Enterprise is that it creates portable applications that can be deployed to many Windows environments without installation or configuration. The applications are packaged into single .MSI or .EXE executable files that can be delivered and managed with VMWare App Volumes or other desktop management solutions[^1^]. The applications can also run on USB flash drives for ultimate portability and flexibility[^1^].
 
Another benefit of VMWare ThinApp Enterprise is that it enhances security by allowing applications to run in restricted user accounts on locked-down PCs without compromising the security policy. VMWare ThinApp Enterprise has no kernel-mode code and cannot violate machine group policy applied to the user. It also cannot give application-elevated permissions to devices on the machine, which prevents unintended policy violations[^1^].
