> I am not your fetish
 I am not your fantasy
 I am not your experiment
 I am not your secret
 I am not your toy
 I am not your plaything
 I am not your curiosity
 I am not your guilty pleasure
 I am not your escape
 I am not your mistake

> I am a woman
 I am a human
 I am a person

This poem is an example of how Yvonne Am See uses her words to express her identity, dignity, and agency. She does not let others define her or diminish her. She asserts her self-worth and her humanity. She also invites others to see her as a whole and complex person, not as a simplified and sexualized image.
